# MochiBot: Mochi's Little Assistant 

📝 Note: This is still working in progress since I just started learning programming and github platform.

# **Usage**

### Manual Usage

📝 Note: I will soon make it where you can run MochiBot internally without
needing to type the this whole command down below!

_On Linux_: 

Open a terminal and run the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mochimosh101/MochiBot/main/Menu.sh)"
```
